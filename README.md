V_0: Rotating turret attempt suring summer break of 2020. Sentry design was inherently flawed and while the project meet the bare minimum for success, the ability to move and fire autonomously, it did neither well enough to merit satisfaction.

V_1: Stationary sentry made during winter break of 2020. Project in progress.
